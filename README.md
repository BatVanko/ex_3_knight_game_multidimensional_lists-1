# ex_3_knight_game_multidimensional_lists-1

Chess is the oldest game, but it is still popular these days. It will be used only one chess piece for this task - the Knight. 
A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated. It can move to the nearest square but not on the same row, column, or diagonal. (e.g., it can move two squares horizontally, then one square vertically, or it can move one square horizontally then two squares vertically - i.e., in an "L" pattern.) 
The knight game is played on a board with dimensions N x N.
You will receive a board with "K" for knights and "0" for empty cells. Your task is to remove knights until no knights that can attack one another with one move are left.
